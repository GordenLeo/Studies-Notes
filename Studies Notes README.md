第一章 辩太阳病脉症并治 
Chapter I: Differentiation and Treatment of Taiyang Disease Based on Pulse and Symptoms
第一条 太阳之为病，脉浮，头项强痛而恶寒。
Clause 1: In disease of the Tàiyáng, the pulse is floating, the head and nape are stiff and painful, and there is aversion to cold‌
第二条 太阳病，发热，汗出，恶风，脉缓者，名为中风。
Clause 2: In Taiyang disease, if there is fever, spontaneous sweating, aversion to wind, and a moderate pulse, it is called Zhongfeng (Wind Strike).
第三条 太阳病，或已发热，或未发热，必恶寒，体痛，呕逆，脉阴阳俱紧者，名为伤寒。
Clause 3: In Taiyang disease, whether fever has already appeared or not, there must be aversion to cold, generalized body pain, retching, and a pulse in which both yin and yang are tight. This is called Shanghan (Cold Damage).
第四条 伤寒一日，太阳受之，脉若静者为不传；颇欲吐，若躁烦，脉数急者，为传也。
Clause 4: On the first day of Cold Damage (Shanghan), when the Taiyang channel is affected, if the pulse is calm, it indicates no transmission. If there is a tendency to vomit, or restlessness and vexation with a rapid and urgent pulse, it indicates transmission.
第五条 伤寒二三日，阳明少阳症不见者，为不传也。
Clause 5: In Cold Damage (Shanghan), if on the second or third day there are no signs of Yangming or Shaoyang patterns, it indicates no transmission.
第六条 太阳病，发热而渴，不恶寒者，为温病。若发汗已，身灼热者，名风温。风温为病，脉阴阳俱浮，自汗出，多眠睡，鼻息必鼾，语言难出。若被下者，小便不利，直视，失溲；若被火者，微发黄色，剧则如惊痫时，时瘛疭，若火熏之。一逆尚引日，再逆促命期。
Clause 6: In Taiyang disease, if there is fever and thirst without aversion to cold, it is classified as a Warm disease. If sweating has been induced and the body becomes burning hot, it is called Wind-Warmth (Fengwen). In Wind-Warmth disease, the pulse is floating in both yin and yang, there is spontaneous sweating, a tendency to sleep much, loud nasal breathing with snoring, and difficulty in speech. If purged, there will be urinary difficulty, staring eyes, and incontinence. If subjected to fire treatment, there will be slight yellow discoloration, or in severe cases convulsions resembling epilepsy, with occasional spasms as if scorched by fire. One erroneous treatment prolongs the disease; a second erroneous treatment hastens death.
第七条 病有发热恶寒者，发于阳也；无热恶寒者，发于阴也。发于阳，七日愈；发于阴，六日愈。以阳数七，阴数六故也。
Clause 7: If the disease presents with both fever and aversion to cold, it is said to affect the Yang; if there is no fever but aversion to cold, it affects the Yin. When it affects the Yang, it resolves in seven days; when it affects the Yin, it resolves in six days. This is because the Yang is counted as seven and the Yin as six.
第八条 太阳病，头痛至七日以上自愈者，以行其经尽故也。若欲作再经者，针足阳明，使经不传则愈。
Clause 8: In Taiyang disease, if headache persists but resolves spontaneously after more than seven days, it is because the course of the channel has been completed. If it is about to progress into another channel, acupuncture on the Foot Yangming should be applied, so that the disease does not transmit and will thus resolve.
第九条 太阳病欲解时，从巳至未上。
Clause 9: In Taiyang disease, the time when resolution is about to occur is between the hours of Si (9–11 a.m.) and Wei (1–3 p.m.).
第十条 风家，表解而不了了者，十二日愈。
Clause 10: In patients with a Wind condition, if the exterior syndrome is relieved but not completely resolved, recovery will occur on the twelfth day.
第十一条 病人身大热，反欲得近衣者，热在皮肤，寒在骨髓也；身大寒，反不欲近衣者，寒在皮肤，热在骨髓也。
Clause 11: When the patient has great heat in the body yet desires to be covered with clothing, it means the heat is on the surface (skin) while cold is in the marrow. When the patient has great cold in the body yet does not wish to be covered with clothing, it means the cold is on the surface while heat is in the marrow.
第十二条 太阳中风，阳浮而阴弱，阳浮者，热自发；阴弱者，汗自出。啬啬恶寒，淅淅恶风，翕翕发热，鼻鸣干呕者，桂枝汤主之。
Clause 12: In Taiyang Zhongfeng (Wind Strike), when the yang is floating and the yin is weak—floating yang causes spontaneous fever, and weak yin causes spontaneous sweating. If there is shivering with aversion to cold, aversion to wind with slight chills, alternating sensations of fever, nasal congestion with noisy breathing, and dry retching, then Guizhi Decoction is indicated.
桂枝汤方 
桂枝三两（去皮） 芍药三两  甘草二两（炙） 生姜三两（切） 大枣十二枚（劈）
Guizhi Decoction (Guizhi Tang):
Guizhi (Cinnamon Twig) 3 liang (with bark removed)
Shaoyao (Peony Root) 3 liang
Gancao (Licorice Root, honey-fried) 2 liang
Shengjiang (Fresh Ginger), sliced, 3 liang
Dazao (Jujube), split, 12 pieces
上五味，呋咀三味，以水七升，微火煮取三升，去滓，适寒服，服一升。服已须臾，啜热稀粥一升余，以助药力，遍身漐漐微似有汗者益佳，不可令如水流漓，病必不除。若一服汗出病差，停后服，不必尽剂。若不汗，更服依前法；又不汗，后服小促其间，半日许令三服尽；若病重者，一日一夜服，周时观之；服一剂尽，病症犹在者，更作服；若汗不出，乃服至二三剂。禁生冷、粘滑、肉面、五辛、酒酪、臭恶等物。
Take the above five ingredients, pound the three solid ones coarsely, and add them all into 7 sheng of water. Boil gently over a low fire until reduced to 3 sheng, then remove the dregs. Divide the decoction, taking 1 sheng warm per dose.

After taking the medicine, wait a short while, then drink about 1 sheng of thin hot rice gruel to assist the action of the decoction. It is best if the whole body begins to sweat slightly, like fine beads of perspiration; it must not pour out like flowing water, otherwise the disease will not be resolved.

If after one dose sweating occurs and the illness is resolved, discontinue further administration—the full prescription need not be finished. If there is no sweating, repeat the dose in the same manner; if still no sweating, shorten the interval between doses so that all three doses are completed within about half a day.

If the illness is severe, administer throughout one day and one night, observing the condition at intervals. If after the full one course the symptoms persist, prepare another course. If no sweating has yet occurred, continue for two or three courses.

Prohibited foods: avoid raw or cold items, sticky or greasy foods, meat and flour-based products, the five pungent spices (onion, garlic, leek, chive, etc.), alcohol, dairy, and foul-smelling substances.
第十三条 太阳病，头痛，发热，汗出，恶风，桂枝汤主之。
Clause 13: In Taiyang disease, if there is headache, fever, sweating, and aversion to wind, Guizhi Decoction is indicated.
第十四条 太阳病，项背强几几，反汗出恶风者，桂枝加葛根汤主之。
Clause 14: In Taiyang disease, when there is stiffness and rigidity of the nape and back, with spontaneous sweating and aversion to wind, Guizhi Decoction plus Kudzu Root (Ge Gen Tang) is indicated.
桂枝加葛根汤方
葛根四两  麻黄三两（去节） 芍药二两 生姜三两（切） 甘草二两（炙） 大枣十二枚（劈） 桂枝二两（去皮）
Formula of Guizhi Jia Gegen Decoction
Kudzu root (Radix Puerariae, Gegen) — 4 liang
Ephedra (Herba Ephedrae, Mahuang, stems with nodes removed) — 3 liang
Peony root (Radix Paeoniae, Shaoyao) — 2 liang
Fresh ginger (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Shengjiang, sliced) — 3 liang
Honey-fried licorice root (Radix Glycyrrhizae Praeparata, Zhi Gancao) — 2 liang
Jujube (Fructus Jujubae, Dazao, split) — 12 pieces
Cinnamon twig (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Guizhi, bark removed) — 2 liang
上七味，以水一斗，先煮麻黄、葛根，减二升，去上沫，内诸药，煮取三升，去滓。温服一升，覆取微似汗，不须啜粥，余桂枝法将息及禁忌。臣亿等谨按：仲景本论，太阳中风自汗用桂枝，伤寒无汗用麻黄。今证云汗出恶风，而方中用麻黄，恐非本意也。第三卷有葛根汤证云：无汗恶风，正与此方同，是合用麻黄也。此云桂枝加葛根汤，恐是桂枝中加葛根尔。
Decoct the seven ingredients with one dou (about 2 liters) of water. First boil the Ephedra (Mahuang) and Kudzu root (Gegen), reduce by two sheng, and remove the froth. Then add the remaining herbs, boil until three sheng remain, and strain out the dregs. Warm one sheng is taken; after administration, cover the patient to induce a slight sweat. There is no need to take congee afterward. The methods of convalescent care and dietary prohibitions follow the same rules as with Guizhi Tang.
臣亿 and others respectfully comment: In Zhang Zhongjing’s original Treatise, spontaneous sweating in Taiyang wind-strike is treated with Guizhi Tang, whereas absence of sweating in cold damage is treated with Mahuang Tang. In the present clause, the symptoms are sweating with aversion to wind, yet Mahuang is included in the prescription, which may not be the original intent. In the third scroll, the formula Gegen Tang is indicated for ‘absence of sweating with aversion to wind,’ which accords precisely with the present symptoms, hence Mahuang is appropriate. Since this formula is named Guizhi Jia Gegen Tang (‘Guizhi Decoction plus Kudzu Root’), it may in fact mean simply adding Kudzu root to Guizhi Tang.
第十五条 太阳病，下之后，其气上冲者，可与桂枝汤，方用前法。若不上冲者，不得与之。
Clause 15: In Taiyang disease, after purgation, if the qi surges upward, Guizhi Decoction may be given, using the same method as before. If there is no upward surging, it must not be administered.
第十六条 太阳病三日，已发汗，若吐，若下，若温针，仍不解者，此为坏病，桂枝不中与之也。观其脉症，知犯何逆，随证治之。桂枝本为解肌，若其人脉浮紧，发热汗不出者，不可与之也。常须识此，勿令误也。
Clause 16: In Taiyang disease lasting three days, if sweating, vomiting, purgation, or moxibustion has already been attempted and the disorder still does not resolve, this is a spoiled (complicated) condition, and Guizhi Decoction is no longer suitable. One should examine the pulse and symptoms to determine which error has been committed, and treat according to the presentation. Guizhi Decoction is originally intended to release the muscle (surface). If the patient’s pulse is floating and tight, with fever but no sweating, it must not be given. This should always be kept in mind to avoid mistakes.
第十七条 若酒客病，不可与桂枝汤，得之则呕，以酒客不喜甘故也。
Clause 17: For patients who are habitual drinkers of alcohol, Guizhi Decoction must not be given. If administered, it will induce vomiting, because those accustomed to alcohol dislike sweetness.
第十八条 喘家作，桂枝汤加厚朴杏子佳。
Clause 18: For patients with a history of dyspnea or asthma, when an attack occurs, it is appropriate to use Guizhi Decoction with the addition of Magnolia Bark (Houpo) and Apricot Kernel (Xingzi).
桂枝加厚朴杏子汤方
桂枝三两（去皮） 甘草二两（炙） 生姜三两（切） 芍药三两 大枣十二枚（劈） 厚朴二两（炙，去皮） 杏仁五十枚（去皮尖）
Guizhi Decoction with Magnolia Bark and Apricot Kernel (Guizhi Jia Houpo Xingzi Tang)
Cinnamon Twig (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Guizhi) — 3 liang (with bark removed)
Honey-fried Licorice Root (Radix Glycyrrhizae Praeparata cum Melle, Zhigancao) — 2 liang
Fresh Ginger (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Shengjiang) — 3 liang (sliced)
White Peony Root (Radix Paeoniae Alba, Shaoyao) — 3 liang
Jujube (Fructus Jujubae, Dazao) — 12 pieces (pitted or cut open)
Magnolia Bark (Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis, Houpo) — 2 liang (honey-fried, bark removed)
Apricot Kernel (Semen Armeniacae Amarum, Xingren) — 50 pieces (peeled, tips removed)
上七味，以水七升，微火煮取三升，去滓，温服一升，覆取微似汗。
Decoct the above seven ingredients with seven sheng (about 1400 ml) of water over low heat until three sheng (about 600 ml) remain. Strain out the dregs. Take one sheng (about 200 ml) warm, and cover the patient to induce a slight sweat.
第十九条 凡服桂枝汤吐者，其后必吐脓血也。
Article 19: For those who vomit after taking Guizhi Decoction, they will subsequently vomit pus and blood.
第二十条 太阳病，发汗，遂漏不止，其人恶风，小便难，四肢微急，难以屈伸者，桂枝加附子汤主之。
Article 20: In a Taiyang disorder, after sweating, if the sweat continues to leak without stopping, and the patient fears wind, has difficulty urinating, experiences slight rigidity of the limbs, and finds it hard to flex or extend, Guizhi Decoction plus Aconite (Guizhi Jia Fuzi Tang) is indicated.
第二十一条 太阳病，下之后，脉促胸满者，桂枝去芍药汤主之。
Article 21: In a Taiyang disorder, after purgation, if the pulse is rapid and there is fullness in the chest, Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao (Guizhi Qu Shaoyao Tang) is indicated.
桂枝去芍药汤方
桂枝三两（去皮） 甘草二两（炙） 生姜三两（切） 大枣十二枚（劈）
Formula of Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao:
Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi) — 3 liang (with bark removed)
Licorice (Gancao), honey-fried — 2 liang
Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang), sliced — 3 liang
Jujube (Dazao), pitted and split — 12 pieces
上四味，以水七升，煮取三升，去渣，温服一升。本云：桂枝汤，今去芍药。将息如前法。
Decoction Method:
Decoct the above four ingredients in 7 sheng of water until 3 sheng remain. Remove the dregs and take 1 sheng warm.
Note: This formula is originally Guizhi Decoction, but with Shaoyao removed. The method of convalescent care and dietary prohibitions should follow the same rules as in the original Guizhi Decoction.
第二十二条 若微寒者，桂枝去芍药加附子汤主之。
Article 22 If the patient presents with slight aversion to cold, Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao plus Aconite (Fuzi) Decoction is indicated.
桂枝去芍药加附子汤方 
桂枝三两（去皮）甘草二两（炙）生姜三两（切）大枣十二枚（劈）附子一枚（炮，去皮，破八片）
Formula of Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao plus Aconite (Fuzi)：
Cinnamon Twig (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Guizhi) — 9 g (peeled)
Prepared Licorice (Radix Glycyrrhizae Praeparata, Zhi Gancao) — 6 g
Fresh Ginger (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Shengjiang) — 9 g (sliced)
Jujube (Fructus Jujubae, Dazao) — 12 pieces (pitted and split)
Prepared Aconite (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Praeparata, Fuzi) — 1 piece (processed, peeled, divided into 8 parts; approx. 6–10 g)
上五味，以水七升，煮取三升，去滓，温服一升。本云：桂枝汤，今去芍药，加附子。将息如前法。
Decoct the above five ingredients in 7 sheng of water until 3 sheng remain. Remove the dregs and take 1 sheng warm.
This is essentially Guizhi Decoction, but with Shaoyao removed and Aconite (Fuzi) added. The method of convalescent care and dietary prohibitions should follow the same as in the original Guizhi Decoction.
第二十三条 太阳病，得之八九日，如疟状，发热恶寒，热多寒少，其人不呕，清便欲自可，一日二三度发。脉微缓者，为欲愈也；脉微而恶寒者，此阴阳俱虚，不可更发汗、更下、更吐也；面色反有热色者，未欲解也，以其不能得小汗出，身必痒，宜桂枝麻黄各半汤。
Article 23:
In a Taiyang disorder, after eight or nine days, the condition may resemble malaria, with alternating fever and aversion to cold, with fever predominating over chills. The patient does not vomit, and urination is normal. The fever attacks occur two or three times daily.
If the pulse is slightly relaxed, this indicates recovery. If the pulse is faint and there is aversion to cold, this reflects simultaneous deficiency of yin and yang, and sweating, purgation, or emesis must not be attempted. If the complexion shows a flushed heat, the disorder has not yet resolved; since the patient cannot produce even a slight sweat, generalized itching will occur.
Guizhi-Mahuang Decoction Half-and-Half (Guizhi Mahuang Ge Ban Tang) is indicated.
桂枝麻黄各半汤方 
桂枝一两十六铢（去皮） 芍药 生姜（切） 甘草（炙）麻黄（去节）各一两 大枣四枚（劈） 杏仁二十四枚（汤浸，去皮尖及两仁者）
Formula of Guizhi-Mahuang Decoction Half-and-Half, Guizhi Mahuang Ge Ban Tang：
Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi) — 1 liang 16 zhu (≈ 45 g, peeled)
White Peony Root (Shaoyao) — 1 liang (≈ 30 g)
Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang) — 1 liang (≈ 30 g, sliced)
Prepared Licorice (Zhigancao) — 1 liang (≈ 30 g, honey-fried)
Ephedra (Mahuang) — 1 liang (≈ 30 g, nodes removed)
Jujube (Dazao) — 4 pieces (split)
Apricot Kernel (Xingren) — 24 pieces (soaked, peeled, tips and double kernels removed)
上七味，以水五升，先煮麻黄，去上沫，内诸药，煮取一升八合，去滓，温服六合。本云，桂枝汤三合，麻黄汤三合，并为六合，顿服。将息如上法。 臣亿等谨按：桂枝汤方，桂枝、芍药、生姜各三两，甘草二两，大枣十二枚。麻黄汤方，麻黄三两，桂枝二两，甘草一两，杏仁七十个。今以算法约之，二汤各取三分之一，即得桂枝一两十六铢，芍药、生姜、甘草各一两，大枣四枚，杏仁二十三个另三分枚之一，收之得二十四个，合方。详此方乃三分之一，非各半也，宜云各半汤。
Decoct the above seven ingredients in 5 sheng of water, first boiling the Ephedra (Mahuang) and skimming off the foam. Then add the remaining herbs and continue decocting until 1 sheng 8 he remain. Strain out the dregs and take 6 he warm.
Originally, this method combined 3 he of Guizhi Decoction and 3 he of Mahuang Decoction, taking a total of 6 he in one dose, following the same convalescent care and dietary restrictions as previously described.
According to Minister Yi’s careful calculation:
Guizhi Decoction: Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi), White Peony Root (Shaoyao), and Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang) each 3 liang; Prepared Licorice (Zhigancao) 2 liang; Jujube (Dazao) 12 pieces.
Mahuang Decoction: Ephedra (Mahuang) 3 liang; Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi) 2 liang; Prepared Licorice (Zhigancao) 1 liang; Apricot Kernel (Xingren) 70 pieces.
Using the calculation method, one-third of each decoction was taken:
Cinnamon Twig 1 liang 16 zhu
White Peony Root, Fresh Ginger, Prepared Licorice each 1 liang
Jujube 4 pieces
Apricot Kernel 23 pieces + 1/3 piece = 24 pieces
This combined formula is thus one-third of the original decoctions, not literally “half-and-half”; therefore it is appropriately called Guizhi-Mahuang Decoction Half-and-Half (Guizhi Mahuang Ge Ban Tang).
第二十四条 太阳病，初服桂枝汤，反烦不解者，先刺风池、风府，却与桂枝汤则愈。
Article 24:In a Taiyang disorder, if the patient becomes restless and does not improve after initially taking Guizhi Decoction, first perform acupuncture at Fengchi (GB20) and Fengfu (DU16). Then, administering Guizhi Decoction again will lead to recovery.
第二十五条 服桂枝汤，大汗出，脉洪大者，与桂枝汤，如前法。若形似疟，一日再发者，汗出必解，宜桂枝二麻黄一汤。
Article 25:
In a Taiyang disorder, if after taking Guizhi Decoction there is profuse sweating and a large, flooding pulse, administer Guizhi Decoction again following the previous method.
If the presentation resembles malaria, with alternating chills and fever occurring twice daily, spontaneous sweating will bring resolution. In such cases, Guizhi Decoction with Two Parts Guizhi and One Part Mahuang (Guizhi Er Mahuang Yi Tang) is indicated.
桂枝二麻黄一汤方
桂枝一两十七铢（去皮） 芍药一两六铢 麻黄十六铢（去节） 生姜一两六铢 杏仁十六个（去皮尖） 甘草一两二铢（炙） 大枣五枚（劈）
Formula of Guizhi Er Mahuang Yi Tang, Guizhi with Two Parts Guizhi and One Part Mahuang Decoction：
Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi) — 1 liang 17 zhu (≈ 46 g, peeled)
White Peony Root (Shaoyao) — 1 liang 6 zhu (≈ 34 g)
Ephedra (Mahuang) — 16 zhu (≈ 20 g, nodes removed)
Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang) — 1 liang 6 zhu (≈ 34 g, sliced)
Apricot Kernel (Xingren) — 16 pieces (peeled, tips removed)
Prepared Licorice (Zhigancao) — 1 liang 2 zhu (≈ 31 g, honey-fried)
Jujube (Dazao) — 5 pieces (split)
上七味，以水五升，先煮麻黄一二沸，去上沫，内诸药，煮取二升，去滓，温服一升，日在服。本云：桂枝汤二分，麻黄汤一分，何为二升，分再服。今合为一方，将息如前法。 臣亿等谨按：桂枝汤方，桂枝、芍药、生姜各三两，甘草二两，大枣十二枚。麻黄汤方，麻黄三两，桂枝二两，甘草一两，杏仁七十个。今以算法约之，桂枝汤取十二分之五，即得桂枝、芍药、生姜各一两六铢，甘草十二铢，大枣五枚。麻黄汤取九分之二，即得麻黄十六铢，桂枝十铢三分铢之二，收之得十一铢，甘草五铢三分铢之一，收之得六铢，杏仁十五个九分枚之四，收之得十六个。二汤所取相合，即共得桂枝一两十七铢，麻黄十六铢，生姜、芍药各一两六铢，甘草一两二铢，大枣五枚，杏仁十六个，合方。
Decoct the above seven ingredients in five sheng of water. First boil the Ephedra (Mahuang) once or twice and remove the froth. Add the remaining herbs and boil until two sheng remain. Remove the dregs and take one sheng warm; take during the day. The text says: “Two parts of Guizhi Decoction and one part of Mahuang Decoction,” so why does it become two sheng, divided into two doses? Now it is combined into one formula; convalescent care is the same as before.
Minister Yi and others respectfully note: Guizhi Decoction consists of Guizhi, Shaoyao, and Shengjiang, three liang each; Gancao, two liang; and Dazao, twelve pieces. Mahuang Decoction consists of Mahuang, three liang; Guizhi, two liang; Gancao, one liang; and Xingren, seventy pieces. Now, by calculation, taking five twelfths of Guizhi Decoction yields Guizhi, Shaoyao, and Shengjiang, one liang six zhu each; Gancao, twelve zhu; Dazao, five pieces. Taking two ninths of Mahuang Decoction yields Mahuang, sixteen zhu; Guizhi, ten zhu and two-thirds, rounded to eleven zhu; Gancao, five zhu and one-third, rounded to six zhu; Xingren, fifteen and four-ninths, rounded to sixteen. The combined amounts are: Guizhi, one liang seventeen zhu; Mahuang, sixteen zhu; Shengjiang and Shaoyao, one liang six zhu each; Gancao, one liang two zhu; Dazao, five pieces; Xingren, sixteen pieces. This is the combined formula.
第二十六条 服桂枝汤，大汗出后，大烦渴不解，脉洪大者，白虎加人参汤主之。
Article 26: In a Taiyang disorder, after taking Guizhi Decoction, if there is profuse sweating followed by intense vexation and unquenchable thirst, with a surging and large pulse, Baihu Decoction with Ginseng (Baihu Jia Renshen Tang) is indicated.
白虎加人参汤方 
知母六两 石膏一斤（碎，绵裹） 甘草二两（炙） 粳米六合 人参三两
Baihu Decoction with Ginseng (Baihu Jia Renshen Tang)：
Anemarrhena Rhizome (Zhimu) – 6 liang ≈ 83 g
Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao), crushed and wrapped in cloth – 1 jin (16 liang) ≈ 221 g
Honey-fried Licorice Root (Gancao) – 2 liang ≈ 27 g
Non-glutinous Rice (Jingmi) – 6 he ≈ 90 g
Ginseng (Renshen) – 3 liang ≈ 41 g
上五味，以水一斗，煮米熟汤成，去滓，温服一升，日三服。
Decoct the above five ingredients in 1 dou (≈ 10–11 liters) of water, cook the rice until done and a soup forms. Strain out the dregs, take 1 sheng (≈ 1.04 liters) warm, three times a day.
第二十七条 太阳病，发热恶寒，热多寒少。脉微弱者，此无阳也，不可发汗。宜桂枝二越婢一汤。
Article 27:
In a Taiyang disorder, if there is fever with aversion to cold, with more heat than cold, and the pulse is faint and weak, this indicates absence of Yang, and sweating should not be induced. Guizhi Decoction with two Yuebi (Guizhi Er Yuebi Tang) is indicated.
桂枝二越婢一汤方 
桂枝（去皮） 芍药 麻黄 甘草各十八铢（炙） 大枣四枚（劈） 生姜一两二铢（切） 石膏二十四铢（碎，绵裹）
Guizhi Decoction with Two Yuebi (Guizhi Er Yuebi Tang)：
Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi, peeled) — 18 zhu ≈ 25 g
Peony Root (Shaoyao) — 18 zhu ≈ 25 g
Ephedra (Mahuang) — 18 zhu ≈ 25 g
Honey-fried Licorice Root (Gancao) — 18 zhu ≈ 25 g
Jujube (Dazao), split — 4 pieces ≈ 40 g (approximate, depending on fruit size)
Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang), sliced — 1 liang 2 zhu ≈ 19 g
Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao), crushed and wrapped in cloth — 24 zhu ≈ 33 g
上七味，以水五升，先煮麻黄一二沸，去上沫，内诸药，煮取二升，去滓，温服一升。本云：当裁为越婢汤、桂枝汤合之，饮一升。今合为一方，桂枝汤二分，越婢汤一分。 臣亿等谨按：桂枝汤方，桂枝、芍药、生姜各三两，甘草二两，大枣十二枚。越婢汤方，麻黄二两，生姜三两，甘草二两，石膏半斤，大枣十五枚。今以算法约之，桂枝汤取四分之一，即得桂枝、芍药、生姜各十八铢，甘草十二铢，大枣三枚。越婢汤取八分之一，即得麻黄十八铢，生姜九铢，甘草六铢，石膏二十四铢，大枣一枚，八分之七弃之，二汤所取相合，即共得桂枝、芍药、甘草、麻黄各十八铢，生姜一两三株，石膏二十四铢，大枣四枚，合方。旧云桂枝三，今取四分之一，即当云桂枝二也。越婢汤方见仲景杂方中，《外台密要》一云越婢汤。
Decoct the above seven ingredients in 5 sheng (~5.2 liters) of water. First, boil the Ephedra (Mahuang) once or twice and remove the froth. Add the remaining herbs and boil until 2 sheng (~2.1 liters) remain. Remove the dregs and take 1 sheng (~1.04 liters) warm.
The text states: “Adjust as Yuebi Decoction and Guizhi Decoction combined, take 1 sheng.” Now it is combined into one formula: two parts Guizhi Decoction, one part Yuebi Decoction.
Minister Yi and others respectfully note:
Guizhi Decoction formula: Guizhi, Shaoyao, Shengjiang, 3 liang each; Gancao 2 liang; Dazao 12 pieces.
Yuebi Decoction formula: Mahuang 2 liang; Shengjiang 3 liang; Gancao 2 liang; Shigao ½ jin (~110 g); Dazao 15 pieces.
By calculation:
Take ¼ of Guizhi Decoction: Guizhi, Shaoyao, Shengjiang 18 zhu (~25 g) each; Gancao 12 zhu (~16 g); Dazao 3 pieces (~30 g).
Take 1/8 of Yuebi Decoction: Mahuang 18 zhu (~25 g); Shengjiang 9 zhu (~12 g); Gancao 6 zhu (~8 g); Shigao 24 zhu (~33 g); Dazao 1 piece (~10 g). The remaining 7/8 is discarded.
Combining the two portions gives:
Guizhi, Shaoyao, Gancao, Mahuang 18 zhu (~25 g) each
Shengjiang 1 liang 3 zhu (~19 g)
Shigao 24 zhu (~33 g)
Dazao 4 pieces (~40 g)
This is the combined formula.
The original text mentions Guizhi 3, now taking ¼ corresponds to Guizhi 2. Yuebi Decoction formula can be found in Zhang Zhongjing’s miscellaneous formulas; in Wai Tai Mi Yao it is referred to as Yuebi Decoction.
第二十八条 服桂枝汤，或下之，仍头项强痛，翕翕发热，无汗，心下满微痛，小便不利者，桂枝去桂加茯苓白术汤主之。
Article 28：After taking Guizhi Decoction, or after being purged, if the patient still has stiffness and pain in the head and neck, alternating fever sensations without sweating, fullness with slight pain below the heart, and difficulty in urination, it is indicated to treat with Guizhi Decoction minus Guizhi plus Fuling and Baizhu Decoction.
桂枝去桂加茯苓白术汤方
芍药三两 甘草二两(炙) 生姜(切) 白术 茯苓各三两 大枣十二枚(劈)
Guizhi Decoction minus Guizhi plus Fuling and Baizhu Decoction (Guizhi Qu Gui Jia Fuling Baizhu Tang):
Peony Root (Shaoyao) — 3 liang ≈ 39 g
Honey-fried Licorice Root (Gancao, honey-prepared) — 2 liang ≈ 26 g
Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang, sliced) — 3 liang ≈ 39 g
Atractylodes Rhizome (Baizhu) — 3 liang ≈ 39 g
Poria (Fuling) — 3 liang ≈ 39 g
Jujube (Dazao, split) — 12 pieces ≈ 72 g (approximate, depending on fruit size)
上六味，以水八升，煮取三升，去滓，温服一升。小便利则愈。本云:桂枝汤，今去桂枝，加茯苓、白术。
Decoct the above six ingredients in 1.6 liters (8 sheng) of water until about 600 ml (3 sheng) remain. Remove the dregs, and take 200 ml (1 sheng) warm each time. When urination becomes smooth, the disorder will resolve.
Originally, this was Guizhi Decoction; here Guizhi (Cinnamon Twig) is removed, and Fuling (Poria) and Baizhu (Atractylodes Rhizome) are added.
第二十九条 伤寒脉浮，自汗出，小便数，心烦，微恶寒，脚挛急，反与桂枝汤，欲攻其表，此误也。得之便厥，咽中干，烦躁，吐逆者，作甘草干姜汤与之，以复其阳;若厥愈足温者，更作芍药甘草汤与之，其脚即伸。若胃气不和，谵语者，少于调味承气汤;若重发汗，复加烧针者，四逆汤主之。
Article 29：In cold damage (Shanghan), if the pulse is floating, there is spontaneous sweating, frequent urination, vexation in the heart, slight aversion to cold, and cramping tightness of the legs, yet Guizhi Decoction (Guizhi Tang) is mistakenly given to attack the exterior, this is an error. As a result, there will be sudden collapse with reversal cold (jue), dryness in the throat, agitation and restlessness, and vomiting with counterflow. In such a case, Licorice and Dried Ginger Decoction (Gancao Ganjiang Tang) should be administered to restore yang.
If the reversal resolves and the feet become warm, then administer Peony and Licorice Decoction (Shaoyao Gancao Tang), whereby the legs will extend (the cramping will be relieved).
If the stomach qi is disharmonious, leading to delirious speech, then give a small dose of Regulating Chengqi Decoction (Tiaowei Chengqi Tang).
If excessive sweating has been induced again, and in addition moxibustion with heated needles has been applied, then Sini Decoction (Sini Tang) is indicated.

第三十条 问曰：证象阳旦，按法治之而增剧，厥逆，咽中干，两胫拘急而谵语。师曰：言夜半手足当温，两脚当伸。后如师言，何以如此？答曰：寸口脉浮而大，浮为风，大为虚，风则生微热，虚则两痉挛，病型象桂枝，因加附子参其间，增桂令汗出，附子温经，亡阳故也。厥逆咽中干，烦躁，阳明内结，谵语烦乱，更饮甘草干姜汤，夜半阳气还，两组当热，胫尚微拘急，重于芍药甘草汤，而乃胫伸，以承气汤微溏，则止其谵语，故知病可愈。

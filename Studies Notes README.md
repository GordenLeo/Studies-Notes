第一章 辩太阳病脉症并治 
Chapter I: Differentiation and Treatment of Taiyang Disease Based on Pulse and Symptoms
第一条 太阳之为病，脉浮，头项强痛而恶寒。
Clause 1: In disease of the Tàiyáng, the pulse is floating, the head and nape are stiff and painful, and there is aversion to cold‌
第二条 太阳病，发热，汗出，恶风，脉缓者，名为中风。
Clause 2: In Taiyang disease, if there is fever, spontaneous sweating, aversion to wind, and a moderate pulse, it is called Zhongfeng (Wind Strike).
第三条 太阳病，或已发热，或未发热，必恶寒，体痛，呕逆，脉阴阳俱紧者，名为伤寒。
Clause 3: In Taiyang disease, whether fever has already appeared or not, there must be aversion to cold, generalized body pain, retching, and a pulse in which both yin and yang are tight. This is called Shanghan (Cold Damage).
第四条 伤寒一日，太阳受之，脉若静者为不传；颇欲吐，若躁烦，脉数急者，为传也。
Clause 4: On the first day of Cold Damage (Shanghan), when the Taiyang channel is affected, if the pulse is calm, it indicates no transmission. If there is a tendency to vomit, or restlessness and vexation with a rapid and urgent pulse, it indicates transmission.
第五条 伤寒二三日，阳明少阳症不见者，为不传也。
Clause 5: In Cold Damage (Shanghan), if on the second or third day there are no signs of Yangming or Shaoyang patterns, it indicates no transmission.
第六条 太阳病，发热而渴，不恶寒者，为温病。若发汗已，身灼热者，名风温。风温为病，脉阴阳俱浮，自汗出，多眠睡，鼻息必鼾，语言难出。若被下者，小便不利，直视，失溲；若被火者，微发黄色，剧则如惊痫时，时瘛疭，若火熏之。一逆尚引日，再逆促命期。
Clause 6: In Taiyang disease, if there is fever and thirst without aversion to cold, it is classified as a Warm disease. If sweating has been induced and the body becomes burning hot, it is called Wind-Warmth (Fengwen). In Wind-Warmth disease, the pulse is floating in both yin and yang, there is spontaneous sweating, a tendency to sleep much, loud nasal breathing with snoring, and difficulty in speech. If purged, there will be urinary difficulty, staring eyes, and incontinence. If subjected to fire treatment, there will be slight yellow discoloration, or in severe cases convulsions resembling epilepsy, with occasional spasms as if scorched by fire. One erroneous treatment prolongs the disease; a second erroneous treatment hastens death.
第七条 病有发热恶寒者，发于阳也；无热恶寒者，发于阴也。发于阳，七日愈；发于阴，六日愈。以阳数七，阴数六故也。
Clause 7: If the disease presents with both fever and aversion to cold, it is said to affect the Yang; if there is no fever but aversion to cold, it affects the Yin. When it affects the Yang, it resolves in seven days; when it affects the Yin, it resolves in six days. This is because the Yang is counted as seven and the Yin as six.
第八条 太阳病，头痛至七日以上自愈者，以行其经尽故也。若欲作再经者，针足阳明，使经不传则愈。
Clause 8: In Taiyang disease, if headache persists but resolves spontaneously after more than seven days, it is because the course of the channel has been completed. If it is about to progress into another channel, acupuncture on the Foot Yangming should be applied, so that the disease does not transmit and will thus resolve.
第九条 太阳病欲解时，从巳至未上。
Clause 9: In Taiyang disease, the time when resolution is about to occur is between the hours of Si (9–11 a.m.) and Wei (1–3 p.m.).
第十条 风家，表解而不了了者，十二日愈。
Clause 10: In patients with a Wind condition, if the exterior syndrome is relieved but not completely resolved, recovery will occur on the twelfth day.
第十一条 病人身大热，反欲得近衣者，热在皮肤，寒在骨髓也；身大寒，反不欲近衣者，寒在皮肤，热在骨髓也。
Clause 11: When the patient has great heat in the body yet desires to be covered with clothing, it means the heat is on the surface (skin) while cold is in the marrow. When the patient has great cold in the body yet does not wish to be covered with clothing, it means the cold is on the surface while heat is in the marrow.
第十二条 太阳中风，阳浮而阴弱，阳浮者，热自发；阴弱者，汗自出。啬啬恶寒，淅淅恶风，翕翕发热，鼻鸣干呕者，桂枝汤主之。
Clause 12: In Taiyang Zhongfeng (Wind Strike), when the yang is floating and the yin is weak—floating yang causes spontaneous fever, and weak yin causes spontaneous sweating. If there is shivering with aversion to cold, aversion to wind with slight chills, alternating sensations of fever, nasal congestion with noisy breathing, and dry retching, then Guizhi Decoction is indicated.
桂枝汤方 
桂枝三两（去皮） 芍药三两  甘草二两（炙） 生姜三两（切） 大枣十二枚（劈）
Guizhi Decoction (Guizhi Tang):
Guizhi (Cinnamon Twig) 3 liang (with bark removed)
Shaoyao (Peony Root) 3 liang
Gancao (Licorice Root, honey-fried) 2 liang
Shengjiang (Fresh Ginger), sliced, 3 liang
Dazao (Jujube), split, 12 pieces
上五味，呋咀三味，以水七升，微火煮取三升，去滓，适寒服，服一升。服已须臾，啜热稀粥一升余，以助药力，遍身漐漐微似有汗者益佳，不可令如水流漓，病必不除。若一服汗出病差，停后服，不必尽剂。若不汗，更服依前法；又不汗，后服小促其间，半日许令三服尽；若病重者，一日一夜服，周时观之；服一剂尽，病症犹在者，更作服；若汗不出，乃服至二三剂。禁生冷、粘滑、肉面、五辛、酒酪、臭恶等物。
Take the above five ingredients, pound the three solid ones coarsely, and add them all into 7 sheng of water. Boil gently over a low fire until reduced to 3 sheng, then remove the dregs. Divide the decoction, taking 1 sheng warm per dose.

After taking the medicine, wait a short while, then drink about 1 sheng of thin hot rice gruel to assist the action of the decoction. It is best if the whole body begins to sweat slightly, like fine beads of perspiration; it must not pour out like flowing water, otherwise the disease will not be resolved.

If after one dose sweating occurs and the illness is resolved, discontinue further administration—the full prescription need not be finished. If there is no sweating, repeat the dose in the same manner; if still no sweating, shorten the interval between doses so that all three doses are completed within about half a day.

If the illness is severe, administer throughout one day and one night, observing the condition at intervals. If after the full one course the symptoms persist, prepare another course. If no sweating has yet occurred, continue for two or three courses.

Prohibited foods: avoid raw or cold items, sticky or greasy foods, meat and flour-based products, the five pungent spices (onion, garlic, leek, chive, etc.), alcohol, dairy, and foul-smelling substances.
第十三条 太阳病，头痛，发热，汗出，恶风，桂枝汤主之。
Clause 13: In Taiyang disease, if there is headache, fever, sweating, and aversion to wind, Guizhi Decoction is indicated.
第十四条 太阳病，项背强几几，反汗出恶风者，桂枝加葛根汤主之。
Clause 14: In Taiyang disease, when there is stiffness and rigidity of the nape and back, with spontaneous sweating and aversion to wind, Guizhi Decoction plus Kudzu Root (Ge Gen Tang) is indicated.
桂枝加葛根汤方
葛根四两  麻黄三两（去节） 芍药二两 生姜三两（切） 甘草二两（炙） 大枣十二枚（劈） 桂枝二两（去皮）
Formula of Guizhi Jia Gegen Decoction
Kudzu root (Radix Puerariae, Gegen) — 4 liang
Ephedra (Herba Ephedrae, Mahuang, stems with nodes removed) — 3 liang
Peony root (Radix Paeoniae, Shaoyao) — 2 liang
Fresh ginger (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Shengjiang, sliced) — 3 liang
Honey-fried licorice root (Radix Glycyrrhizae Praeparata, Zhi Gancao) — 2 liang
Jujube (Fructus Jujubae, Dazao, split) — 12 pieces
Cinnamon twig (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Guizhi, bark removed) — 2 liang
上七味，以水一斗，先煮麻黄、葛根，减二升，去上沫，内诸药，煮取三升，去滓。温服一升，覆取微似汗，不须啜粥，余桂枝法将息及禁忌。臣亿等谨按：仲景本论，太阳中风自汗用桂枝，伤寒无汗用麻黄。今证云汗出恶风，而方中用麻黄，恐非本意也。第三卷有葛根汤证云：无汗恶风，正与此方同，是合用麻黄也。此云桂枝加葛根汤，恐是桂枝中加葛根尔。
Decoct the seven ingredients with one dou (about 2 liters) of water. First boil the Ephedra (Mahuang) and Kudzu root (Gegen), reduce by two sheng, and remove the froth. Then add the remaining herbs, boil until three sheng remain, and strain out the dregs. Warm one sheng is taken; after administration, cover the patient to induce a slight sweat. There is no need to take congee afterward. The methods of convalescent care and dietary prohibitions follow the same rules as with Guizhi Tang.
臣亿 and others respectfully comment: In Zhang Zhongjing’s original Treatise, spontaneous sweating in Taiyang wind-strike is treated with Guizhi Tang, whereas absence of sweating in cold damage is treated with Mahuang Tang. In the present clause, the symptoms are sweating with aversion to wind, yet Mahuang is included in the prescription, which may not be the original intent. In the third scroll, the formula Gegen Tang is indicated for ‘absence of sweating with aversion to wind,’ which accords precisely with the present symptoms, hence Mahuang is appropriate. Since this formula is named Guizhi Jia Gegen Tang (‘Guizhi Decoction plus Kudzu Root’), it may in fact mean simply adding Kudzu root to Guizhi Tang.
第十五条 太阳病，下之后，其气上冲者，可与桂枝汤，方用前法。若不上冲者，不得与之。
Clause 15: In Taiyang disease, after purgation, if the qi surges upward, Guizhi Decoction may be given, using the same method as before. If there is no upward surging, it must not be administered.
第十六条 太阳病三日，已发汗，若吐，若下，若温针，仍不解者，此为坏病，桂枝不中与之也。观其脉症，知犯何逆，随证治之。桂枝本为解肌，若其人脉浮紧，发热汗不出者，不可与之也。常须识此，勿令误也。
Clause 16: In Taiyang disease lasting three days, if sweating, vomiting, purgation, or moxibustion has already been attempted and the disorder still does not resolve, this is a spoiled (complicated) condition, and Guizhi Decoction is no longer suitable. One should examine the pulse and symptoms to determine which error has been committed, and treat according to the presentation. Guizhi Decoction is originally intended to release the muscle (surface). If the patient’s pulse is floating and tight, with fever but no sweating, it must not be given. This should always be kept in mind to avoid mistakes.
第十七条 若酒客病，不可与桂枝汤，得之则呕，以酒客不喜甘故也。
Clause 17: For patients who are habitual drinkers of alcohol, Guizhi Decoction must not be given. If administered, it will induce vomiting, because those accustomed to alcohol dislike sweetness.
第十八条 喘家作，桂枝汤加厚朴杏子佳。
Clause 18: For patients with a history of dyspnea or asthma, when an attack occurs, it is appropriate to use Guizhi Decoction with the addition of Magnolia Bark (Houpo) and Apricot Kernel (Xingzi).
桂枝加厚朴杏子汤方
桂枝三两（去皮） 甘草二两（炙） 生姜三两（切） 芍药三两 大枣十二枚（劈） 厚朴二两（炙，去皮） 杏仁五十枚（去皮尖）
Guizhi Decoction with Magnolia Bark and Apricot Kernel (Guizhi Jia Houpo Xingzi Tang)
Cinnamon Twig (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Guizhi) — 3 liang (with bark removed)
Honey-fried Licorice Root (Radix Glycyrrhizae Praeparata cum Melle, Zhigancao) — 2 liang
Fresh Ginger (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Shengjiang) — 3 liang (sliced)
White Peony Root (Radix Paeoniae Alba, Shaoyao) — 3 liang
Jujube (Fructus Jujubae, Dazao) — 12 pieces (pitted or cut open)
Magnolia Bark (Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis, Houpo) — 2 liang (honey-fried, bark removed)
Apricot Kernel (Semen Armeniacae Amarum, Xingren) — 50 pieces (peeled, tips removed)
上七味，以水七升，微火煮取三升，去滓，温服一升，覆取微似汗。
Decoct the above seven ingredients with seven sheng (about 1400 ml) of water over low heat until three sheng (about 600 ml) remain. Strain out the dregs. Take one sheng (about 200 ml) warm, and cover the patient to induce a slight sweat.
第十九条 凡服桂枝汤吐者，其后必吐脓血也。
Article 19: For those who vomit after taking Guizhi Decoction, they will subsequently vomit pus and blood.
第二十条 太阳病，发汗，遂漏不止，其人恶风，小便难，四肢微急，难以屈伸者，桂枝加附子汤主之。
Article 20: In a Taiyang disorder, after sweating, if the sweat continues to leak without stopping, and the patient fears wind, has difficulty urinating, experiences slight rigidity of the limbs, and finds it hard to flex or extend, Guizhi Decoction plus Aconite (Guizhi Jia Fuzi Tang) is indicated.
第二十一条 太阳病，下之后，脉促胸满者，桂枝去芍药汤主之。
Article 21: In a Taiyang disorder, after purgation, if the pulse is rapid and there is fullness in the chest, Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao (Guizhi Qu Shaoyao Tang) is indicated.
桂枝去芍药汤方
桂枝三两（去皮） 甘草二两（炙） 生姜三两（切） 大枣十二枚（劈）
Formula of Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao:
Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi) — 3 liang (with bark removed)
Licorice (Gancao), honey-fried — 2 liang
Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang), sliced — 3 liang
Jujube (Dazao), pitted and split — 12 pieces
上四味，以水七升，煮取三升，去渣，温服一升。本云：桂枝汤，今去芍药。将息如前法。
Decoction Method:
Decoct the above four ingredients in 7 sheng of water until 3 sheng remain. Remove the dregs and take 1 sheng warm.
Note: This formula is originally Guizhi Decoction, but with Shaoyao removed. The method of convalescent care and dietary prohibitions should follow the same rules as in the original Guizhi Decoction.

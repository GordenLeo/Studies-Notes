第一章 辩太阳病脉症并治 
Chapter I: Differentiation and Treatment of Taiyang Disease Based on Pulse and Symptoms
第一条 太阳之为病，脉浮，头项强痛而恶寒。
Clause 1: In disease of the Tàiyáng, the pulse is floating, the head and nape are stiff and painful, and there is aversion to cold‌
第二条 太阳病，发热，汗出，恶风，脉缓者，名为中风。
Clause 2: In Taiyang disease, if there is fever, spontaneous sweating, aversion to wind, and a moderate pulse, it is called Zhongfeng (Wind Strike).
第三条 太阳病，或已发热，或未发热，必恶寒，体痛，呕逆，脉阴阳俱紧者，名为伤寒。
Clause 3: In Taiyang disease, whether fever has already appeared or not, there must be aversion to cold, generalized body pain, retching, and a pulse in which both yin and yang are tight. This is called Shanghan (Cold Damage).
第四条 伤寒一日，太阳受之，脉若静者为不传；颇欲吐，若躁烦，脉数急者，为传也。
Clause 4: On the first day of Cold Damage (Shanghan), when the Taiyang channel is affected, if the pulse is calm, it indicates no transmission. If there is a tendency to vomit, or restlessness and vexation with a rapid and urgent pulse, it indicates transmission.
第五条 伤寒二三日，阳明少阳症不见者，为不传也。
Clause 5: In Cold Damage (Shanghan), if on the second or third day there are no signs of Yangming or Shaoyang patterns, it indicates no transmission.
第六条 太阳病，发热而渴，不恶寒者，为温病。若发汗已，身灼热者，名风温。风温为病，脉阴阳俱浮，自汗出，多眠睡，鼻息必鼾，语言难出。若被下者，小便不利，直视，失溲；若被火者，微发黄色，剧则如惊痫时，时瘛疭，若火熏之。一逆尚引日，再逆促命期。
Clause 6: In Taiyang disease, if there is fever and thirst without aversion to cold, it is classified as a Warm disease. If sweating has been induced and the body becomes burning hot, it is called Wind-Warmth (Fengwen). In Wind-Warmth disease, the pulse is floating in both yin and yang, there is spontaneous sweating, a tendency to sleep much, loud nasal breathing with snoring, and difficulty in speech. If purged, there will be urinary difficulty, staring eyes, and incontinence. If subjected to fire treatment, there will be slight yellow discoloration, or in severe cases convulsions resembling epilepsy, with occasional spasms as if scorched by fire. One erroneous treatment prolongs the disease; a second erroneous treatment hastens death.
第七条 病有发热恶寒者，发于阳也；无热恶寒者，发于阴也。发于阳，七日愈；发于阴，六日愈。以阳数七，阴数六故也。
Clause 7: If the disease presents with both fever and aversion to cold, it is said to affect the Yang; if there is no fever but aversion to cold, it affects the Yin. When it affects the Yang, it resolves in seven days; when it affects the Yin, it resolves in six days. This is because the Yang is counted as seven and the Yin as six.
第八条 太阳病，头痛至七日以上自愈者，以行其经尽故也。若欲作再经者，针足阳明，使经不传则愈。
